# Advanced Gaming Mechanics Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the integration of research-backed advanced gaming mechanics into Data_Bleed's existing framework. The goal is to enhance the educational horror experience through sophisticated trust systems, adaptive AI, environmental storytelling, and resource management that serves both narrative and pedagogical objectives.

## Glossary

- **Trust Score System**: Dynamic vulnerability tracking system (-100 to +100) using Bayesian networks
- **Chroma Bot**: AI antagonist with adaptive deception capabilities
- **Environmental Storytelling**: 3D space manipulation that communicates narrative through visual/audio cues
- **Resource Scarcity Mechanics**: Strategic constraints on verification attempts, time, and trust expenditure
- **Learning Objective Tracking**: Bloom's Taxonomy-based skill progression monitoring
- **Dialogue Choice Framework**: DAG-based conversation system with consequential branching
- **Safe Zone Design**: Tension/relief rhythm management across character areas
- **Cross-Character Knowledge Transfer**: Shared learning experiences between Maya, Eli, and Stanley

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Advanced Trust Score System Implementation

**User Story:** As a player experiencing digital manipulation, I want a sophisticated trust system that reflects real-world vulnerability patterns, so that I learn how context and emotional state affect my susceptibility to scams.

2. WHILE Maya engages in romantic scenarios, THE Trust Score System SHALL apply -20 baseline penalty and 1.5x emotional manipulation multipliers
3. WHEN Eli faces peer pressure in gaming contexts, THE Trust Score System SHALL apply 1.3x peer pressure multipliers and gaming-specific vulnerability patterns
4. WHILE Stanley encounters elder-targeted scams, THE Trust Score System SHALL weight loneliness factors at 2.0x and tech-savvy factors at 0.5x
5. THE Trust Score System SHALL provide real-time animated feedback with warm glows in safe zones and red flickers during manipulation
6. WHERE players demonstrate advanced understanding, THE Trust Score System SHALL unlock deep analytics showing vulnerability profile breakdowns

### Requirement 2: Adaptive AI Deception Engine Enhancement

**User Story:** As a player learning to identify manipulation, I want an AI antagonist that adapts its tactics based on my responses, so that I experience realistic escalation patterns used by real scammers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player successfully identifies manipulation tactics, THE Chroma Bot SHALL record the detection and switch to more sophisticated approaches
2. WHILE the Trust Score decreases, THE Chroma Bot SHALL escalate emotional pressure using quintic easing algorithms
3. IF the player shows excessive skepticism, THEN THE Chroma Bot SHALL implement counter-pressure tactics and urgency manipulation
4. WHEN 2 minutes remain in timed scenarios, THE Chroma Bot SHALL increase language urgency AND trigger audible heartbeat feedback
5. THE Chroma Bot SHALL maintain character-specific manipulation profiles with Maya facing romance scams, Eli experiencing gaming exploitation, and Stanley encountering elder fraud
6. WHERE players reach critical vulnerability thresholds, THE Chroma Bot SHALL implement "perception hack" moments that make players question the interface itself

### Requirement 3: Environmental Storytelling Through 3D Spaces

**User Story:** As a player navigating digital dangers, I want the 3D environment to reflect my emotional and security state, so that I viscerally understand how manipulation affects perception.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trust Score drops below -20, THE 3D Environment SHALL implement progressive corruption with 2000ms smooth lighting transitions
2. WHILE Chroma Bot escalates manipulation, THE Environmental System SHALL darken lighting, add glitch effects, and introduce uncanny digital artifacts
3. THE Environmental System SHALL maintain distinct visual/audio cues for each character's six areas following tension/relief rhythm curves
4. WHEN players enter safe zones, THE Environmental System SHALL provide warm lighting, stable textures, and calming audio cues
5. IF manipulation reaches critical levels, THEN THE Environmental System SHALL make familiar spaces subtly wrong with flickering screens and distorted text
6. THE Environmental System SHALL tie every visual/audio element to narrative state through backend environmental metadata

### Requirement 4: Resource Scarcity and Strategic Constraints

**User Story:** As a player learning cybersecurity principles, I want limited resources that force strategic thinking, so that I understand real-world constraints in threat assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Resource System SHALL provide 3-5 verification attempts per dialogue sequence with strategic depletion
2. WHEN players use cautious actions, THE Resource System SHALL implement trust expenditure costs that affect momentum
3. THE Resource System SHALL enforce 5-7 minute narrative time limits with accelerating pressure via quintic easing
4. WHILE time pressure increases, THE Resource System SHALL trigger simultaneous audio feedback intensification and visual urgency cues
5. IF players exhaust verification attempts, THEN THE Resource System SHALL force decisions based on incomplete information
6. THE Resource System SHALL teach cybersecurity principles: "You can't verify everything—strategize," "Excessive skepticism triggers counter-pressure," and "Real scammers exploit time urgency"

### Requirement 5: Dialogue Choice Framework with Learning Integration

**User Story:** As a player making conversation choices, I want a sophisticated dialogue system that tracks my reasoning and unlocks advanced options based on demonstrated understanding, so that learning progression feels natural and rewarding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dialogue System SHALL implement directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) allowing convergent paths and consequential branching
2. WHEN players identify emotional manipulation tactics, THE Dialogue System SHALL record the detection and unlock verification questions for advanced players
3. THE Dialogue System SHALL track not just player choices but reasoning quality through learning evaluation algorithms
4. WHILE conversations progress, THE Dialogue System SHALL make early choices affect dialogue options 10+ turns later
5. THE Dialogue System SHALL implement nested consequences where skill acquisition unlocks new dialogue paths
6. WHERE players demonstrate pattern recognition, THE Dialogue System SHALL provide hidden branches accessible only to players who caught earlier inconsistencies

### Requirement 6: Cross-Character Knowledge Transfer System

**User Story:** As a player completing multiple character journeys, I want knowledge gained from one character to subtly influence other characters' experiences, so that I understand how cybersecurity awareness applies across different demographics and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN players complete one character's journey, THE Knowledge Transfer System SHALL provide subtle hints about other characters' vulnerabilities
2. THE Knowledge Transfer System SHALL create intersecting narrative moments where characters' stories briefly overlap
3. WHILE playing subsequent characters, THE Knowledge Transfer System SHALL reference previous character experiences through news reports or similar scenarios
4. THE Knowledge Transfer System SHALL reward attentive players with cross-character pattern recognition opportunities
5. THE Knowledge Transfer System SHALL demonstrate universal cybersecurity principles while maintaining individual narrative integrity
6. WHERE players show mastery with one character, THE Knowledge Transfer System SHALL adjust difficulty and provide advanced scenarios for other characters

### Requirement 7: Learning Outcome Tracking and Assessment

6. THE Learning System SHALL maintain persistent learning profiles that inform future gameplay adaptations

### Requirement 8: Integrated Feedback Loop Orchestration

4. THE Integration System SHALL create authentic consequences where choosing "trust" during financial pressure darkens lighting, adds clock-ticking audio, and triggers specific Chroma manipulations
5. THE Integration System SHALL record decision patterns and adapt future scenarios based on demonstrated learning needs
6. THE Integration System SHALL ensure every mechanic serves both educational and narrative goals simultaneously
